## The problem

[](start with the question, “what’s the one thing I want people to learn, or feel, or do, as a result of hearing this?”. Tim Harford)

[](To understand why writing a reproducible paper is a good thing, and how to do it.)

- The scholarly publication process is slow and lumpy
- But scientific knowledge is incremental
	- And there are always more questions than there's time to answer
- How can Docker and reproducible research help?

## Outline

- Background to reproducible research
- Where Docker fits into this
- Benefits, challenges and open questions 

## Reproducible Research

- Knuth; literate programming
- R "ecosystem"
	- Reproducibility works well here
	- Complexity when we leave "`R`-land"


## Reproducible Research in R

- `knitr` allows us to interleave markdown or `LaTeX` with `R` code
	- R session persists throughout document
		- Code chunks can be cached
	- Supports other languages -- but no persistence between chunks
  - Reproducible papers give the freedom to "dig" if you want; otherwise they look like a "normal" paper (and are no more reproducible).

## Reproducible Research in R (minimal example)

```{r}
x <- 1:10
y <- x**2
```


## Reproducible != Reusable

- Reproducibility is a good thing
	- It makes you do things *properly*
	- It lets others check your work
- It doesn't (necessarily) make it easy to _reuse_ or _extend_ your work 
 ** repeatability too **

## Docker Pipelines for Reproducible, Reusable Research

- By breaking our analysis pipeline into sections we obtain a
_more flexible_ workflow, which makes incremental improvement / extension of the work easier
- Docker facilitates this
- Use a Makefile to handle dependencies between "modules" 
	- Makes the manuscript just another "modules"

## Example
- Show diagram of manuscript workflow
- Overlay Docker images, and languages used within them

## Docker images
- Each module contains its own Makefile
- Example:
  - CppMT tracking
  
## "Master" Makefile
- Handles dependencies between the Docker image modules
- Calls the final Docker image to produce manuscript

## Extent of reproducibility

- At what stage do our data come into project?
  - We chose to take the video files, and extracted depth frames
  - Decision may be less clear-cut in other research domains
  
## Extensible papers

- Docker provides the containerisation which makes it easy to build the manuscript anywhere
- Submit manuscript by inviting publisher to clone manuscript repository
- Publisher `Make`s package and sends to reviewers
- Reviewers review paper (and underlying code)
- Article published; paper of record
- Repository (sent to e.g. Figshare) is repository of record

## Extensible papers

- Publisher has produced paper of record
- Extensions (or corrections) to the paper can be built by:
`git pull`
`make`
- VC and Makefile make it obvious what's changed ==> lighter weight peer review

## Tips

- Test textual assertions with `R` code:

> "The value of $\tau^2$ was at least twice its value under the previous model"

```
if(tausq.new < 2.0 * tausq.old) {
  warning("Text assertion failed")
}
```

## Challenges

- Slow analyses
- Tying Docker and R together
- More difficult than working non-reproducibility
   - A difficult sell?
   - Pre-prepared infrastructure?
- Compiling the manuscript text outwith the process
- Analysis vs results (i.e. analysis is the processing of, e.g. CppMT output)
- User decisions in compilation process - i.e. setting bounding box 
- Random numbers
- Modules running in Docker containers are more difficult to debug/extract intermediate information from

## Benefits

- Can work each element of the paper back to its source
- It makes fixing mistakes easier
- Each module (Docker image) can be used independently of the others
  - Reusability
- Input directories to each module are mounted read only
	- Guarantees data can't be overwitten
