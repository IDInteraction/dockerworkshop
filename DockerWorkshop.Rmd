## The problem

[](start with the question, “what’s the one thing I want people to learn, or feel, or do, as a result of hearing this?”. Tim Harford)

[](To understand why writing a reproducible paper is a good thing, and that it follows naturally from containerising one's research.)

- The scholarly publication process is slow and lumpy
- But scientific knowledge is incremental
	* And there are always more questions than there's time to answer
- How can Docker and reproducible research help?

## Outline

- Background to reproducible research
- Where Docker fits into this
- Benefits, challenges and open questions 

## Reproducible Research

## Reproducible Research in R

- `knitr` allows us to interleave markdown or `LaTeX` with `R` code
	* R session persists throughout document
		- Code chunks can be cached
	* Supports other languages -- but no persistence between chunks
 
  * Can produce something that looks _identical_ to a "normal" paper
    	- Paper source needed for reproducibility

```{r, echo=FALSE,  comment=NA}
writeLines(readLines("ExamplePaper.Rnw"))
```

## Reproducible != Reusable

- Reproducibility is a good thing
	* It makes you do things *properly*
	* It lets others check your work
	* It lets others repeat your work
- It doesn't (necessarily) make it easy to _reuse_ or _extend_ your work 

## The future shape of academic research outputs

- Should something like an academic paper be the "standard" research output?
  * Is this better than, e.g. a Jupyter notebook? If so, why?
    - Audience; who reads it and why?
    - Researcher evaluation/assessment; cultural shift, relative (perceived) values of, e.g. notebooks vs journal articles
- Rightly or wrongly academic papers are likely to be a primary means of scientific dissemination for a while

## Docker Pipelines for Reproducible, Reusable Research

- By breaking our analysis pipeline into sections we obtain a
_more flexible_ workflow, which makes incremental improvement / extension of the work easier
- Docker facilitates this
- Use a Makefile to handle dependencies between "modules" 
- The manuscript is then just another "module"

## Example

![](WorkflowContainers.png)

## Docker images
- Each module contains its own Makefile
- Example: CppMT tracking
  
  
---

## Top-level Makefile
- Handles dependencies between the Docker image modules
- Calls the final Docker image to produce manuscript

## Extensible papers

- Modularity using Docker makes it easier to extend papers
- Also allows paper to be built anywhere
  - In principle allows the publisher/reviews to check manuscript _code_.

- Version control makes it obvious what's changed between versions/extensions ==> lighter weight peer review


## The paper as software

- Treating the paper as "just another part" of the software development process lets us use:
	* Version control
	* Continuous integration
	* Unit testing


## Tips

- Test textual assertions with `R` code
- Make intermediate files in modules "precious" 
	* Avoids wasted work in slow modules
- Make the Knitr paper runable on native system
  	* Allows interactive writing / analysis

## Challenges

- Extra overhead 
  	* Minimised if working reproducibly from the outset
	* Manuscript container could be shared
	* Good "glue" to streamline workflow is important
- Working on the analysis and manuscript interactively

Challenges are minimised if you research reproducibly from the start - all you need is the "glue"

## Benefits

- Each module (Docker image) can be used independently of the others
  - Reusability _and_ reproducibility
- Can trace each figure in the paper back to its source
- Can _fully_ understand methodology
- Paper is self consistent
- Could reshape publication process
